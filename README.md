# Project-10: LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH NGINX AND SSL/TLS

DevOps engineer must be a versatile professional and know different alternative solutions for the same problem. That is why, in this project we will configure an Nginx Load Balancer solution to replace the Apache Load Balancer configured in Project-8 while the architecture remains the same.

It is also extremely important to ensure that connections to your Web solutions are secure and information is encrypted in transit â€“ This project-10 will also cover connection over secured HTTP (HTTPS protocol), its purpose and what is required to implement it.

Task
This project consists of two parts:

1. Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer

2. Register a new domain name and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates
